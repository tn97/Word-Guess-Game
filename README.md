# Word-Guess-Game
* This project is a Hangman-based game, or a Word-Guess-Game, whichever you prefer.

* The project was a great way to practice my early knowledge of javascript, as it gave me a way to practice what i knew and thought i knew. 

* This project was maintained by me and me only, if you want to take on this task of creating a game like this, i suggest that you learn some Javascript first; it is quite difficult.
